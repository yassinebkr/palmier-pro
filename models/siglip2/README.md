# SigLIP 2 — semantic footage search

We use a CLIP-style model to power visual search in the editor: agents and
users search footage by content, with the model running locally. The model is
downloaded at runtime and not bundled in the app.

## The model

SigLIP 2 B/16-256 (https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-base-patch16-256) by
Google, run with Core ML (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml).

## Building the Core ML packages

There's no official Core ML build, so we convert it ourselves:

```
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
uv pip install -p .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python convert.py --checkpoint checkpoint --out build-q8 --palettize-bits 8
```

(See convert.py for how to fetch the checkpoint first.) The script traces both
encoders to .mlpackage, quantizes to 8-bit, and aborts unless the converted
model's embeddings match PyTorch's (cosine ≥ 0.99). `export_tokenizer.py`
regenerates the Swift tokenizer golden tests.

## Hosting

The build output (two encoder zips, tokenizer.zip, manifest.json) is uploaded to
huggingface.co/palmier-io/siglip2-base-coreml.

## Download

The app downloads the artifacts from the repo above on first use and verifies
them against the sha256s pinned in SearchIndexConfig.swift, which is also where
the URL lives.

## License

SigLIP 2 weights are Apache 2.0 (Google); our converted artifacts are
redistributed under the same terms, with attribution in the HF model card.
