The index is a stable, global, 0-based position in timeline order; pass it straight to remove_words to cut that word (the intuitive path for text-based editing). Words are monotonic and non-overlapping; each is attributed to one clip, so a word split across a clip seam is emitted once. Indices stay global even when scoped with clipId or paged with a window. Capped at 10000 words total; page with startFrame/endFrame using nextStartFrame.

Use this instead of hand-setting transforms and screenshot-checking alignment with inspect_timeline.\n\nYou pick a named layout and assign a clip to each of its slots; the tool computes every transform and crop so each clip FILLS its region edge-to-edge WITHOUT stretching — the source is cropped to the slot's shape (cover), like a layout template the videos are dropped into. Pass fit='fit' to letterbox the whole source inside its slot instead (no crop, may leave bars) — use only when the full frame must stay visible (e.g. a screen recording).\n\nThe crop is centered by default. When that chops off something important (a face cropped at the forehead, a subject off to one side), bias which part survives: 'anchor' is a coarse shortcut ('top' keeps the top, etc.), while anchorX/anchorY (0–1) give continuous control for in-between framing — e.g. anchorY 0.35 moves the crop only slightly toward the top, not all the way. To nudge framing after the fact, call apply_layout again with adjusted anchorX/anchorY (clipIds mode re-crops in place).\n\nTwo modes (don't mix across slots):\n• Place new clips: give each slot a 'mediaRef' (from get_media) plus top-level startFrame (default 0) and durationFrames. Creates one stacked video track per slot at that time range; for PIP the inset is placed on top automatically. Video clips bring their linked audio.\n• Re-layout existing clips: give each slot 'clipIds' — one or more existing clips, all framed into that slot (handy when a track holds several sequential takes). Only transforms/crop change — timing and tracks are untouched (so existing track order decides stacking).\n\nEvery slot of the chosen layout must be filled. Layouts and their slot names:\n  • full — main\n  • side_by_side — left, right\n  • top_bottom — top, bottom\n  • pip_bottom_right / pip_bottom_left / pip_top_right / pip_top_left — main, inset\n  • grid_2x2 — top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right\n  • main_sidebar — main (70%), sidebar (30%)\n  • three_up — left, center, right",
